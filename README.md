## Purpose
I created these files as a way to better understand bitwise operators and practical use
When developers are challenged by memory limitation or have high speed requirement as for
embedded systems (FR : systemes embarques) like drones, bitwise operators come in handy.

* 1.0 Introduction to Bitwises operators.
* 1.1 Learn how to print (display) bits.
* 1.2 Learn how to reverse a byte.
* 1.3 Check if a number is power of 2 or not.
* 1.4 Learn how to use bitwise operators to save memory when parsing.
* 1.5 upcoming...
